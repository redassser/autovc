# Introduction

**It's a tough balance, as an administrator, making sure there are always enough voice channels for your users while trying not to crowd the server with empty channels. What if you didn't have to worry managing voice channels anymore?**

Use __"init autovc"__ to create the category - "auto-vc" - the bot will reside in.
This bot __requires__ the "manage channels" permission to function. 

Whenever a user joins the one empty voice channel in the category, another one will be created, allowing for more individual channels and conversations. The channels are deleted as the last user leaves the channel, making sure there is always only one open channel.

Channel creation is infinitely reliable, useful for servers both large and small (Especially large), and very lightweight. You can also include your own text channels in the auto-vc category!
